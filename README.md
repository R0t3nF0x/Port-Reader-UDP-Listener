# Port-Reader-UDP-Listener
Port Scanner (TCP/UDP) with UDP Listener
Project Overview:

This is my second project on GitHub, where I created a simple port scanner for known TCP and UDP ports. Initially, I didn’t know much about ports or how they worked, but through building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of networking and how different ports function in a network.

The project includes:

    TCP Port Scanner: Scans TCP ports on a given IP address to check if they are open or closed.

    UDP Port Scanner: Scans UDP ports and uses a UDP listener for testing if the port is open.

Although the code might not be the cleanest or most readable (I’m still learning!), it represents something special to me because I built it myself. It was a valuable learning experience and a way for me to dive deeper into networking concepts, including socket programming and how communication works over TCP and UDP.
Features:

    TCP Port Scanning: Checks for open or closed TCP ports on a given IP address.

    UDP Port Scanning: Tests UDP ports with a simple listener to determine if they are open.

    UDP Listener: A basic UDP listener to validate if the UDP part of the scanner works correctly.

Lessons Learned:

    Understanding TCP and UDP protocols

    Learning how to use sockets in C for network communication

    Debugging networking code and improving performance
